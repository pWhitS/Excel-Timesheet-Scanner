Bug Fix - implemented loading of special names from config file

Imported CSheetData into timecalc.py
	- Mutable objects are being shared as expected

New test excel file - Shutdown Staff Schedule 2015
	- Looks to be properly formatted =)
	- Added new worksheet names and max cells to config file
	- Testing bug fixes on one worksheet at a time


8-18-15:
Added output file as a parameter in the configuration file.
- Program now outputs to a file

Excel file has all properly formatted times.
- Time parser seems to work with proper time formats
- Probably needs more in-depth testing  

Could use some comments.
- Code base is growing to be somewhat large and complex

Bugs:
- employee.checkTotalHours()
	- Fails at full scale because of badly designed scheduled hours calculator
	- Rething how scheduled hours are calculated
	- Need to deal with multiple scheduled ranges for one day per name  
- Special cell values not always delt with
	- implement loaded special names from config file


8-16-15:
Added configuration file and input/parsing of that file
- Created config.py
	- CConfigParser class
- Created xlscan.conf
	- Hopfully helpful comments
	- Example configuration


8-15-15:
Added time parsing logic to deal more accuratly with time range calculation
- Converts internally to 24-hour time
- Uses RegEx and datetime.datetime library for parsing time strings
- Mutable attributes move into __init__() 
	they were being shared accross class instances

Bugs:
- the 12:00am problem
	time ranges such as 3:00pm-12:00am do not calculate correctly
	3:00pm -> 15:00
	12:00am -> 0:00

- Excel sheet is being read incorrectly at times.
	blank cells after 1 hour blocks are being read as .5 misc_hours
